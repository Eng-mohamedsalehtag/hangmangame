Hangman — Web Hangman Game

Description
- A simple web-based Hangman game built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Guess the letters of a hidden word before your attempts run out.

Quick Start
- Open start.html to start from the landing page.
- Or open index.html directly to play with a random word. You can pass a category via the query string, for example: index.html?category=Programming.
- Use category.html or the "Change Category" button in-game to pick a category.

Controls
- Click the on-screen letter buttons or use your keyboard (a-z).
- Selected letters are disabled and incorrect letters appear under "wrong letters".
- Phrases with spaces (e.g. movie titles) display spaces automatically.

Customizing Words
- The word list and categories are in script.js inside the wordsWithCategories array — add or edit words there.

Main Files
- start.html
